  	  <p>Playing video games or other digital games on a computer, a gaming console or a mobile device is referred to as gaming. It entails frequently engaging with fictional worlds, obstacles, and characters within the game to reach particular objectives, finish missions, or outperform other players. With its many genres and experiences—including action, adventure, role-playing, strategy, sports, and more—gaming has grown to be a well-liked form of entertainment. In addition, communities have grown up around different games where players may communicate, work together, and compete online. Online gaming has become a trendy hobby for many people. Competing online has become so popular that people consider the pro scene of video games called “esports.”</p>

      <h4 class = "subtopic">How gaming impacted me</h4>
  	  <p>My name is Arwin Muraleetharan, and I am currently a second-year student at the University of Guelph. I have been gaming since I was 9, about 10 years of my life. Gaming was something that always was around me. My family is full of gamers, so I was introduced pretty early. I have played on many different platforms, so I have excellent experience with gaming. I have learned many other skills with gaming. My cognitive skills are improving because of the amount of problem-solving and critical thinking I have to do when playing video games. It was very challenging in some of the games I played, and I needed to make quick decisions. This required me to develop cognitive adaptivity and flexibility. Another skill I developed was hand and eye coordination. Many games require the skill to focus on controlling the character, so it takes the skill of coordination. This also makes a good practice for multi-tasking.</p>

      <p>Gaming is such a huge stress reliever for me. It is like an escape from reality because I engage in a virtual world and focus on my game. This distracts from my problems that cause stress in real life. Gaming got me through a lot, and I am grateful for that. The final way gaming impacted me is for relaxation purposes. Gaming is one of the most entertaining activities to do for fun. Relaxing and playing video games is excellent after a long day at work or finishing school homework. It's also a great way to interact with friends and enjoy their company without going out. Therefore, this is how gaming impacted my life.</p>

      <h4 class = "subtopic">Covid and Gaming</h4>
  	  <p>The COVID-19 epidemic had a significant effect on the gaming market and players' habits all across the world. Due to lockdowns and other social isolation tactics, people spent more time at home, significantly increasing gaming participation. My school was cancelled then, so my primary focus was gaming. Player engagement in multiplayer games and online gaming platforms increased, enabling social connection and communication in situations of physical isolation. My friends and I were online chatting while playing games together due to the lack of in-person interaction because of the lockdown restrictions. As a result, more consumers, including my friends and I, bought gaming equipment, software, and in-game items, which increased revenue for the gaming business. As traditional sports and live events were suspended, e-sports and game streaming likewise became increasingly popular. I started watching a lot of streamers and online gaming tournaments on Twitch. Twitch is a famous streaming platform for gamers. Games' virtual worlds functioned as venues for online social gatherings, allowing parties and other activities to go on in distant locations.</p>

  	  <p>Furthermore, gaming evolved into a mental health outlet for many, alleviating stress and anxiety during uncertain times. During Covid, I felt lonely and anxious, but with the help of gaming, it was easy to connect with my friends and enjoy my time with them. Educational games also played a role in remote learning as schools shifted to online education. However, the pandemic also disrupted game development processes, causing delays in releases and updates. One of the only flaws is the delay of updates for new games. Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the growth and acceptance of gaming as a mainstream form of entertainment and social interaction, leaving a lasting impact on the gaming industry and gaming habits.</p>
